## My process

### Built with

-   Figma
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   ES6 Modules
-   JavaScript Classes

### What I learned

The project's design was pretty straightforward, and I spent most of my time working with JavaScript. Using classes and modules was something I did before, but I enjoyed the opportunity to get some experience with these modern JavaScript features. I also improved my "scaling technique" to get from a static to a responsive design.

### Continued development

After I finished the project, I realized that using `transform: scale()` is not the best way to get a responsive design in this case. It would be better to change the aspect ratio of the website according to the user's screen. So, in the following projects, I want to limit my use of the scale function.
